    <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>
    <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data. This training data contains both input features and output labels. Supervised learning algorithms are generally used for tasks where we want the algorithm to learn the mapping between the input features and the output labels.</p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spam filtering</li>
        <li>Image classification</li>
        <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
        <li>Fraud detection</li>
        <li>Natural language processing (NLP)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows collecting data and produces data output from previous experiences</li>
        <li>Helps to optimize performance criteria with the help of experience</li>
        <li>Supervised machine learning helps to solve various types of real-world computation problems</li>
        <li>It performs classification and regression tasks</li>
        <li>It allows estimating or mapping the result to a new sample</li>
        <li>We have complete control over choosing the number of classes we want in the training data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Classifying big data can be challenging</li>
        <li>Training for supervised learning needs a lot of computation time</li>
        <li>Supervised learning cannot handle all complex tasks in Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Computation time is vast for supervised learning</li>
        <li>It requires a labelled data set</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evaluating Supervised Learning Models</h2>
    <p>Evaluating supervised learning models is an important step in ensuring that the model is accurate and generalizable. There are a number of different metrics that can be used to evaluate supervised learning models, but some of the most common ones include:</p>

    <pre>
    For Regression
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)

    For Classification
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1 score
    - Confusion matrix
    </pre>

    <h2>Common Supervised Learning Algorithms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression</li>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
        <li>Decision Trees</li>
        <li>Random Forests</li>
        <li>Naive Bayes</li>
    </ul>
