<h1>Unsupervised Learning</h1>
<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves algorithms that find patterns and insights within data without the need for predefined labels. These algorithms work by making assumptions about the underlying structure of the data, rather than learning the structure from specific examples.</p>
<h2>Algorithms</h2> <p>Some common unsupervised learning algorithms include:</p>
<ul> <li>Clustering algorithms, such as k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and GMMs, which are used to group similar data points together.</li>
    <li>Association rule learning algorithms, such as Apriori Algorithm, Eclat Algorithm, FP-Growth Algorithm, and Association rule learning, which are used to identify patterns in a data.</li> </ul>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul> <li>Does not require training data to be labeled, which can save time and effort.</li>
    <li>Dimensionality reduction can be easily accomplished using unsupervised learning.</li>
    <li>Capable of finding previously unknown patterns in data.</li>
    <li>Unsupervised learning can help you gain insights from unlabeled data that you might not have been able to get otherwise.</li>
    <li>Unsupervised learning is good at finding patterns and relationships in data without being told what to look for. This can lead to a more complete understanding of the data and potentially discover hidden trends or correlations that might otherwise go unnoticed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It can be more challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of non-supervised learning models, as there is no ground truth data to compare the modelâ€™s predictions to.</li>
    <li>Uncertainty and model interpretability can be difficult, as the algorithms make assumptions about the underlying structure of the data rather than learning the structure from specific examples.</li>
    <li>The efficiency of unsupervised learning algorithms can be limited by the amount and complexity of the data, as well as the resources available to run the algorithms.</li>
</ul>
