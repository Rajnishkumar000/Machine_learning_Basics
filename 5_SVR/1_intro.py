# There is a tube which has a vertical value from a line both up and down to which we limit our error or allow
# that margin of error that tube is known as epsilon insensitive tube

# WE dont care about the point inside the tube but we are cared about the point inside it to minimize
# we have to minimize (Ei+Ei*)

# The error inside the tube is ignored
# any point can be represented as a vector from the origin
# the ones outside the tube are support vector
# some are potentially supported
